         <h1> Pieces Of Our Project </h1>
        <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcIJN5fNrGv1SoyvAWPESFRWMh3dtBcbkaRuhRgB3a4/edit?usp=sharing">Game Concept Clarification</a></h2>
         <p1> Linked above is out Game Concept Clarification Document. In this document we layed out some of the basis for what the game truly was.
             This was the first time we had to think about some aspects of the game such as age range for the game, core mechanics, and many other little
             things that had passed our minds. This document was a big part of our project because it allowed us to thnk of all the basic things needed 
             for games instead of only making it fun. 
         </p1>
         <h2>Character Draft Design</h2>
         <p class="ex1"> This is one of our first simple mock designs for our game characters. This was just to get a feel for how big the character would be 
             and could end up making it's way into the final design of the game. </p>

         <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJKRi-Zs5-f0N1fW-HFWp_4zUjB3I6emlqD0BZ2XKi0/edit">Flow Chart/Pseudo Code</a></h2>
         <p1> This is our flowchart/pseudo Code. We did this exercise so we could understand the process of coding on a more simple level. 
             The pseudo code was just a simple code that wouldn't actually work for any language. We still made sure to make our own rules 
             for the code though to fully give the feel of real coding.
         </p1>
         <h2> Coin</h2>
         <center><img src="Images/coin.jpg" alt="Coin" width="512" height="342"></center>    
         <center><p1> This is our coin for our game. This will be used as a fun representation of money.</p1></center>    
         <h2>Our Game Cards</h2>
         <p1> This was our first draft for our game pieces. This was to get a feel for how we wanted our game cards to look like and in 
             the end we used a design very similar to these ones. We also have the game board here.
